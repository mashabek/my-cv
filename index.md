# Bek Masharipov
Software Engineer

My work has ranged from industrial HMI apps to full e-commerce sites, so I’m used to switching fields and tools. From office apps to self-driving tech, I write code that gets things moving - people, machines, and new ideas.

I reach for .NET most often, but I’ll use whatever stack fits the job best.
